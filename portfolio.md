## Projects
[**Neural Quantum states from a Computational perspective**](https://github.com/Overskott/Neural-quantum-states-from-a-computational-perspective)
- Master's thesis project
- Implemention in python of an approach for learning the energy ground state of an given 1/2 spin quantum system based on a neural network, the Restricted Bolzmann Machine.

**Quevo** [Github](https://github.com/Overskott/Quevo)
- Implementation in Python and Quiskit for a pilot project done through the [NordSTAR](https://www.oslomet.no/en/nordstar) research group at Oslo Metropolitan university.
- It generates simulated quantum circuits to fit a desired probability outcome for eight initial conditions based on a cellular automata.

**Open AI gym project** [Github](https://github.com/Overskott/OpenAIgym-project?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Approach written in Python to solve the open AI gym pole-cart problem.
- Shows that a 1-dimensional cellular automaton and a simple neural network can be trained by evolutionary algorithms to solve the cart in the pole-cart problem.
