    "Hi! 👋 Former musician turned tech enthusiast here! I've traded in my guitar for a keyboard and dived headfirst into the worlds of computer engineering, math, and science."\n
    
    "At Ruter AS, I geeked out as a part-time Data Engineer, using machine learning and quantum computing to predict passenger capacity in public transport. 🚆
    As a Teacher Assistant at Oslomet, I helped students tackle calculus nightmares and quantum mysteries. It was a blast! 
    I dipped my toes into research at NordSTAR, playing with Qiskit and evolutionary algorithms to create quantum circuits. 📝 
    Before all this, I rocked it as a Product Manager at Prolyd AS, handling sales, logistics, and training for professional audio gear. 🎧 
    Now, armed with a Master's in Applied Computer and Information Technology, I'm all about programming and Data science!"\n
    
    "Life's not all about work! When I'm not coding or problem solving, you can find me jamming on my bass guitar or exploring the great outdoors. 🏞️"
