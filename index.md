## Porfolio

# Notable academic projects
[**Neural Quantum states from a Computational perspective**](https://github.com/Overskott/Neural-quantum-states-from-a-computational-perspective)
- Master's thesis project

**Quevo** [Github](https://github.com/Overskott/Quevo)
- Implementation in Python and Quiskit for a pilot project done through the [NordSTAR](https://www.oslomet.no/en/nordstar) research group at Oslo Metropolitan university
- It generates simulated quantum circuits to fit a desired probability outcome for eight initial conditions based on a cellular automata
- Published at [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-14926-9_11), 2022

**Open AI gym project** [Github](https://github.com/Overskott/OpenAIgym-project)
- Approach written in Python to solve the open AI gym pole-cart problem
- Shows that a 1-dimensional cellular automaton and a simple neural network can be trained by evolutionary algorithms to solve the cart in the pole-cart problem
